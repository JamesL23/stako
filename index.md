## Welcome to STAKO

Our goal is to add to your experience as an Stack Overflow user while supporting the site's inclusivity efforts. STAKO does that by analyzing Q&A page visits, testing new engagement strategies, and providing you with personalized feedback.

STAKO stores your Stack Overflow visits, provides personalized statistics, and adds to your experience of Stack Overflow Q&A pages.
